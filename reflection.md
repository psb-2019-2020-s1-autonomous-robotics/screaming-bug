#What We Learned
We learned how to use Ultrasonic sensors through our robot. We feel more confident in our ability to build more advanced robots due to greater confiednce in using Lego MINDSTORMS and VSCode.

#What Worked Well
We finished the initial build of our robot very early (Around mid November) so we were able to add more fun and innovative feautures.

#What We Would Do Differently
Have a more specific plan from the start. For the majority of the project, we mainly improvised, which was fine, but we could have benefitted from slightly more structure.
